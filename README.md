# heartbeat

A clojure library that currently makes your Mac (currently only OSX compatible)
play really terrible gabber (yes it's intentionally obnoxious) at a speed
dependent on your machine's load average.

Yes it plays a shitty kick drum/hi-hat sequence which goes faster if you leave
all your tabs open

## Usage

Why would you want to use it? (use leinengen, lein repl, have fun)
